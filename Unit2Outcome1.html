<h1>Describe Issues That People with Disabilities may Face When Using Webpages</h1>

<strong>Blindness:</strong>

<p>Blindness involves loss of vision in your eyes. Most individuals who are blind would rely on screen readers, which is a software that reads text on the screen with a synthetic voice and/or braille displays. </p>

<u>Barriers that people with blindness may encounter include:</u> 

<p> Images that do not have alt text 

<br>

Videos that do not describe in text or audio.  </p>

<strong>Low Vision:</strong>

<p>Low Vision comes in many forms. For example, tunnel vision and poor acuity. People with low vision may use extra-large monitors and increased fonts for images and text. 
</p>

<u>Barriers that people with low vision may encounter on the Web include: 
</u>

<p>Web pages with font sizes that do not enlarge easily. 
    Web pages that are hard to navigate when enlarged </p>

<strong>Colour Blindness:</strong>

<p>Colour blindness occurs when you are unable to see colours in a certain way. For example, finding it hard to distinguish between colours.
    Colour blindness results in some people not being able to see any colour.
    To ensure the text is readable it should pass accessibility guidelines based on the combination of text color, background color and text size 
    </p>

<u>Barriers include:</u>

<p> Browsers that do not support user override of author's style sheets</p> 

<strong>Deafness:</strong>

<p> Deafness involves having substantial impaired hearing. 
    To use the Web, people may rely on captions for audio content. </p>


<u>Barriers may include:</u> 

<p>Lack of captions or transcripts for audio content</p> 


<strong>Motor:</strong>

<p>Motor disabilities can include weakness, and limitations of muscular control.
    To use the web, people with motor disabilities  may use voice recognition software, a specialised mouse, a head-pointer, or other technologies that help assist to interact. 
</p>

<u>Barriers that people with motor disabilities may encounter include:
</u>

<p>
    Time-limited response actions 
    Browsers that do not support the technology </p>

 <strong>Seizure Disorder:</strong>

 <p>Individuals with seizure disorders can be triggered by visual flashing and flickering lights, or audio at a certain frequency. 

    To use the Web, people with seizure disorders may turn off audio or animations. Often, it is mentioned in advance that certain visuals may trigger seizures. </p>


<h1>Describe Which are the Appropriate Filetypes for Websites</h1>

<p> The two most common file types used on the web are GIF (Graphic Interchange Format) and JPEG (Joint Picture Experts Group)[9]. It is suggested to use these formats when creating web graphics. However, GIF and JPEG are used differently, therefore, it is important to know which is appropriate to use for certain images. </p> 

<p> JPEG is good for photographs and images with colour gradients. 
    JPEGs can provide millions of colours and very high levels of detail to produce photorealistic images with relatively low file sizes.[10]</p>
    
<p> JPEGs are not good for images with text, as it can cause the text to blur. Also, using transparent images, wouldn't work as JPEG does not support transparency. 
    <br> 
    The GIF image format can reproduce text, blocks of solid colour and crisp edges without blurring. GIF images lack a wide-range colour palette, therefore, it would be harder to to reproduce images with a smooth colour gradient, whereas JPEGs are better for this.</p>         


<h1>  Describing Copyright and Other Constraints Affecting Websites</h1>

<p> It is important to respect the rules around copyright; the right to copy. This includes your own right, and others. 
    Copyright laws help protect an original creator, from others using and profiting from their work. 
    <br> 
    If infringed, legal action can be taken.
    <br>  
    Copyright extends beyond video to songs, images, blogs, paintings, and even software, plus more. 
</p>


<h1>Describing the Content and Layout for Each Page</h1> 

<p>

My main focus was to keep my website simple and sophisticated. My reason for this was to reflect my personal online experience. 

Each page on my website (other than my perosnal pages) has the same design for the background, this is to maintain a consistent theme.</p> 



<p> In addition to this, I did extra research for my website so I can make it look more tidy. For example, the underline function, which allowed me to underline certain smaller headings. 

Overall, my main focus was to keep my pages elegant, and informative.</p>
