<h2>2.1 Review the Ongoing use of IT Tools and Change Approach as Needed in Making your Website</h2>  

<p>
    When making my website, the main tools I used were: Visual Studio Code, Trello, Pages and iCloud.

    Visual Studio Code is where most of the magic happens; so I will begin with this tool first. I had to ensure everything was coded correctly at the start, in order to begin creating my website. I enjoyed using Visual Studio Code, as it is a tool I am now becoming familiar with. 
    
    There are a few interesting techniques I learnt to format my website in an organised way. For example, the use of '<strong>strong</strong>' allowed me to make sentences other than my heading in a bold font.</p>


<p> Trello is a tool which needs constant updating, which is important as it allows me to update myself on what needs to be done. Trello is simple to use and helped me plan my day ahead more efficiently. 
    
    I used Pages mainly for the context of my website, which I then added into Visual Studio. 
    
    Lastly, iCloud was a great way to manage my project flexibly. For example, if I didn’t have my laptop on me. I could work on the context of my website using my phone as everything automatically updates on my devices. </p>

<br> 

<h2> 2.2 Describe Whether the IT Tools Selected were Appropriate</h2> 

<p> Visual Studio Code was appropriate for my website as I was able to write my code speedily. Furthermore, being able to test my website was extremely helpful as I could correct anything I didn’t feel looked right. In addition to this, VSC picks up any errors, so if my code wasn’t appropriate, I was able to go over and check why - this was beneficial for my learning and practise. 

    

<p> Trello is appropriate for task management. The Kanban boards are shareable and flexible. Not only this, but each card allows you to add a great amount of information, which is good for detail. Lastly, it is easy to use, and a simple yet effective way of staying on top of tasks. </p>

    <br> 

<h2>2.3 Assess the Strengths and Weaknesses of your Final Project </h2> 

<p> From looking over my website, I definitely think the context is a strength as I have answered all questions in as much detail as possible. 
    I am also pleased with how my time-lapses appeared on the website. I spent time filming and editing the time lapses further (by adding sound and effects) to make them more eye-catching. </p>

    
    
<p> If I had to change my website, I would most likely share more content in my ‘about me’ page to make it personal. 
    
    Overall, I am happy with my website. There are certain things I would have added to make it more visually aesthetic. However, this was my first time creating a website, so being able to code and create a website that works is an achievement in itself. </p>   

    <br>  

<h2> 2.4 Describe Further Improvements you can Take to your Project</h2>

<p> If I could make any further improvements, I would make my website more interactive. For example, add puzzles and easter eggs so that my user remains interested. 

    Examples of puzzles I would have included are word searches and riddles. An easter egg I would have included would be a different style of cursor for my website. 
 <br> 

    In addition to this, I would spend more time enhancing my home page.</p> 

 <br> 

<h2> 2.5 Review Outcomes to Make Sure They Match Requirements and are Fit for Purpose </h2>

<p> From reviewing outcomes, I have ensured that the links used for my website work. For example, my Trello board has been linked, which will allow my user to look at my plan and completed tasks in a web browser.</p>  


<p> I have organised and combined my information so it is readable for my user. I did this by including paragraphs, to break up my text, so it is clear to read. In addition to this, I have used bold large text for my headings to make each section clear. 
    
    Lastly, I have checked through my website to ensure that there are no errors. This is so that my user can access my website smoothly and enjoy my final product, without any errors.</p>
