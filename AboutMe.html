<h1>A Day In The Life of San</h1>  

<p>
Welcome to my website, my name is Sanaa. But most people call me San. 
<br>
I enjoy filming; particularly creating time lapses (patience is a virtue). </p>


<p> I have always been passionate about expressing emotion through art. 
    During A-levels, I created a mini documentary touching on my journey with mental health.</p>         


<p> I enjoy writingh poems based on personal experiences. One of my most memorable moments was winning a competition from a poem I had written.
    Through this achievement, I won a scholarship.</p>  

    
<p> I have two main reasons for joining Code Nation. The first being to challenge myself in something out of my comfort zone. 
    I am the go to techie in my family. I enjoy editing images and videos. However, coding is something completely new to me. 
    Almost completed, I have enjoyed every moment of it!</p>

    
<p> The second reason why Code Nation is important to me; to build experience in a new field, and develop my skill-set for my dream job </p>
