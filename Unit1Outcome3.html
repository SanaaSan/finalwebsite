<h1> 3.1 Review the Benefits and Drawbacks of IT Tools and Systems Used in Terms of Productivity and Efficiency</h1> 

<p>
    One huge benefit using Visual Studio Code is how efficient it is to code. Once you have practised a code, it is very simple to continue with the rest of the code. 

    My main focus for the website was the context. However, I do feel that with more time I would have been able to focus more on the visuals for the website. 

    
<p> Trello was helpful for reminding me what tasks I needed to be complete. However, with the time I had to create my website, I feel that updating it frequently resulted in less coding time. But, I know with more time - this wouldn’t have been as challenging. 
    
    Teamwork is very important to me. I think that working in a team would be interesting, unique and creative. 
    This is because everyone would have their own ideas and bring something different to the design. (However, creating a website, in a short time-frame, with a larger group, would require a lot more planning.)</p>  

</p>

<h1> 3.2 Describe Ways to Improve Productivity and Efficiency </h1>

<p> I feel with the time given to create my website, I managed as efficiently as possible. Perhaps, one thing I could have done differently was not expand so much on the context; to allow more time for the design. However, for me it was important to do so, as I wanted my text to be clear and informative for my user.</p>
    
<p> Away from my website, I took regular breaks and stayed hydrated to remain productive and focused.</p>


<h1> 3.3 Develop Solutions to Improve own Productivity Using IT in Digital Projects </h1>

<p> When creating a website in the future, with a longer time-scale to work on it. I would do a lot more planning and research. This would be in order to add more unique features to make it accessible to all users. 
    For example, audio content for people who may not be able to read what I have written.</p>

<p> Working in a team would allow for a more creative online experience for our user. This is based on the fact that each team member would have a different perspective on how the website should look. 
    To make this work, perhaps each member could come up with a design for a different page. Communication via Slack would be great for this, as you can have your group in the same chat room at once. 
    Overall, a team website  would create a unique feel for our user. </p>  



<h1>3.4 Describe how you Would go About Testing Digital Solutions</h1> 

<p> Firstly, whilst creating my website, I tested it as I went along to avoid creating any huge errors. 
    Doing this also enabled me to add more detail in certain places I felt relevant. Since completing my website, I have checked over it to ensure all my links work, and that  it looks well presented.</p> 
   
<p> Secondly, I asked my friend to look at the website so I could receive some feedback. They were impressed and particularly liked the  ‘About me’ and ‘Time Lapse’ page, they felt it made it more personal and adds to who I am.
    I also ensured my website would work using line server.</p>
