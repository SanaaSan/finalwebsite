<h1>1.1 Describing the Purpose of IT in Modern Business</h1>   

<br> 

<strong> The Business:</strong>  

<p> Information Technology in modern business provides the ability to communicate.
    Emails and online meetings are prime examples, of how a business can communicate within their team.</p>


<p> Technology provides business efficiency. For example, computer checks can avoid errors, which may come at a cost - these checks help support business growth. 
    In addition to this, technology protects businesses from viruses and cyber attacks, which is important as there may be confidential documents and data. 
    By having computers with passwords, a business can ensure none of its forthcoming projects will be copied by the competition. [1] This can also prevent hacking. </p>


<p> Information technology allows businesses to make better decisions. 
    For example, Market research can now be done via online surveys (to get feedback), reviewing public opinion on social media, and through using Web analytics.
    <br>
    Business analytics is such a critical field. It enables companies to know their users' wants and needs.[2]
    Through analysing data, a business is able to continue growing by monitoring what works best.</p>


<p> Lastly, Information technology has given businesses the tools to stay organised. 
    For instance, Kanban boards and Google Calendar have made it easier to plan. </p>

<br> 

<strong> The Customer:</strong> 

<p> Customers can receive support from multiple channels. 
    Websites allow businesses to reach out to their customer. 
    Information such as location, hours and contact info (which offers instant customer support) are all accessible. 
    Benefitting both the customer and business.</p>  


<br> 


<h1> 1.2 Describing Methods, Skills and Resources Needed to Complete Digital Projects Successfully</h1> 

<br> 

    <strong>Independently:</strong> 

    <br> 

<p> When working independently, it is important to plan and focus on your idea. You have to be able to create your own structure well. 
    Trello is a collaboration tool that organises your projects into boards.[3]</p>

    <p> Trello allows you to make different to-do lists, and check them off once you have completed your tasks. 
        This is a good method to help you focus on what needs to be done before moving onto the next stage of your project. 
        It also acts as a reminder for tasks you may have forgotten to complete.</p>

    <br> 
    
    <strong>Teamwork:</strong> 

<p> Working in a team requires a great deal of communication, Slack is one way to liaise your ideas, with your team. 
    Using the chat room, you are able to share links, images and a large context of text, which is beneficial for big projects. 
    In addition to this, stand-up meetings are effective for group projects as it offers structure and briefs everyone on the work that needs to be done for that day.</p>

<p> Lastly, adhering to deadlines is important, both in a team and independently. 
    Deadlines provide a sense of motivation and achievement, which is key when creating a successful Digital Project.</p>

<br> 

<h1>1.3 How Will You Plan and Carry out Tasks Using IT</h1>  

<p>
    When planning, I like to brainstorm a few ideas and jot them down in my notes. That way, I have something to choose from. Once I have decided on my final idea, I will ensure to stick to that theme, so I can plan accordingly. 
    I want my website to reflect my personal online experience. For example, I appreciate websites that are subtle and well laid out.</p> 
    

<p> I will ensure to keep my Trello board updated to stay on top of everything. 
    For all projects, it is important to get feedback. So once I have a plan in place, I will share the aesthetics for my website - to see how other people find it.</p> 

    <br>

<h1>1.4 Describe the Risks That Might Impact Digital Projects</h1>

<p> Firstly, it is important to note the type of risks that may arise. For example, something that could go wrong during the project, and how to prevent that risk early on.</p>

<p> A huge risk that may impact digital projects to fail is lack of planning. A good digital project planning process will have the "Known/Known" risks built in. 
    This means creating risk mitigation plans (Plan B) along with timing, and budget contingencies. [4] Planning provides structure, and being able to manage time more productively.
    Without a plan in place, you may find yourself focusing too much on the short-term goal, and vice versa - missing out on crucial ways to better your project.</p>

<p> Lastly, cost risk could potentially impact digital projects. This could be down to poor estimating accuracy and scope creep. [5] 
    Businesses face competition, for instance, a competitor releases a new site with a great new feature that could draw your customers away.[6] 
    <br> 
    This reflects why planning and research is so crucial, as it can prevent a businesses loss.</p>

<br> 

<h1>1.5 Describe how you Would go About Selecting and Using IT Systems and Software </h1>

<p> It is important to know what you want the software to do. 
    Once you have an idea, it is worth creating a list of software requirements. For example, functional requirements; what you need the software to do. 
    Another example is usability requirements; is the software manageable for me to use - if not, what are the alternatives. 
    Lastly, technological preferences; if using a Mac, you are able to store everything in the cloud, ensuring your work is safely backed-up and on all your devices.</p> 






<h1>1.6 Describe and Provide Analysis on how your Chosen Technologies Have Helped you Achieve your Outcomes.</h1>

<p> Trello has allowed me to plan for my project in an organised manner, and check off everything I have completed. Since creating my list with three colour coded labels: to-do, doing and done - I can access and focus on the tasks I am yet to complete. Trello simply helps me stay on top of everything 

    iCloud allows me to work on different devices at any given time, which has provided me the flexibility to work on my project in depth. Also, my work is safely backed-up in case of any errors. 
    <br>
    Slack, allows me to communicate ideas or any questions I have efficiently. Also, if I ever need to refer back to anything it is easily obtainable.</p> 

    
<p> Git can help manage project files, as it keeps track of your entire history of activities you have been working on. Git can provide flexibility, for example, if I want to experiment, I can always revert back to my original code. 
    Github acts as a social networking site for developers. This can help with my version of code as, people are able to access it and even suggest changes. 
    Communication with others on Github, may even help improve my own code, as it is a space for me to practise and receive feedback.</p>

<br> 

<h1>1.7 Describe Legal Guidelines and Constraints that Impact Digital Projects </h1>


<p> Websites are required to comply with legislation, and to be updated in accordance with the law.

    The GDPR regulations came into effect in May 2018. It is one of the most significant pieces of legislation improving the rights of individuals to understand how their personal data is being processed. [7] 
    
    Below are a few examples of what websites must include to comply with GDPR:

    <br> 
    
    Websites  must be easy for users to withdraw their consent or opt out i.e. subscriptions. 

    <br> 
    
    Users must be notified of cookies that are being used to track their behaviour, the user would usually have to accept this. </p> 

    <br>  

<p>  
    A data breach process must be in place, as back-up. It is the responsibility of a business to prevent personal data from being compromised i.e. hacking. If data is to be breached, 
    companies can face fines.
    
<br> Websites must be accessible. If it isn't, you may be in breach of the Equality Act 2010. [8]
     Functions such as screen magnifiers and readers are an example of how to support people with disabilities.</p>
